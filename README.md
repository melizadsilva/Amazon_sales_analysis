## Recommendations
* **Expand Presence in the African Market:**  Given that the African region has the highest number of products bought, increase investment in marketing and distribution channels in this region. Consider localized promotions and partnerships with local influencers.

* **Improve North American Market Penetration:** Develop strategies to increase product awareness and availability in North America, such as offering special promotions, free shipping, and better online user experiences.

* **Enhance Offline Sales Strategy:** Since household items, cosmetics, and beverages are top items bought offline, ensure that these products are well-stocked and promoted in physical stores. Consider in-store promotions and discounts to attract more customers

* **Improve In-Store Experience:** Invest in improving the customer experience in physical stores through better store layouts, customer service, and faster checkout processes.

* **Leverage Online Marketing for Cosmetics:** Since cosmetics are equally popular online and offline, use targeted online marketing campaigns, influencer partnerships, and social media ads to boost online sales further.
